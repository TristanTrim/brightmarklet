# brightmarklet
It's a portmanteau of brightspace and bookmarklet.

# How?

Drag the link found at [the gh-pages site](https://tristantrim.github.io/brightmarklet/) into your bookmarks. Go to brightspace. Click bookmarklet. Enjoy.

# Why?

Brightspace menus make me feel crazy.

# But why a bookmarklet?

I think they are easy, neat, and fun.

Please add feature requests : )
