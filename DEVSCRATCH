# Request grid menu:

let resp = "";
const Http = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url='https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/lp/courseSelector/6606/InitPartial';
Http.open("GET", url);
Http.send();

Http.onreadystatechange = (e) => {
  resp = Http.responseText;
}


# Other urls

# Course selector. Should return course codes
https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/lp/courseSelector/6606/InitPartial
# grades. needs course code
https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/lms/grades/my_grades/main.d2l


# brightspace api does exist... Maybe I'll look at it a bit
